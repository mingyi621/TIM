This is the implementation of the following paper:

==================================================
A-Long Jin, Wei Song, Ping Wang, Dusit Niyato, and Peijian Ju, "Auction Mechanisms Toward Efficient Resource Sharing for Cloudlets in Mobile Cloud Computing" in "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING, VOL. 9, NO. 6, NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016" pp. 895-909.
==================================================

I have implemented the two algorithms, TIM and EDA, as two Java programs.
Using the "input.txt" file to input the four variables:

1. The number of the sellers.
2. The number of the buyers.
3. The ask array of the sellers.
4. The bid arrays of the buyers.

Using the file "TIM/TIM_ObjTest.java" and "EDA/EDA_ObjTest.java" to output the results of the algorithms TIM and EDA, respectively. The output result will be saved in the file "output.txt".

If you have any questions about my Java programs, please contact me by sending an email to "mingyi621@gmail.com".

Thanks.
